WELCOME!

To use this configuration file make sure you drop in the ".cfg" file in your CSGO games directory. 
  - In Steam, right click on CSGO and click "Manage" and click "Browse Local Files"
  - Open the File Explorer, and direct yourself to the cfg folder. csgo --> cfg 
  - Drag the "autoexec.cfg" file in the "cfg" folder. 
  - In Steam, right clock on CSGO and click "Properties" under "Launch Options" input "+exec autoexec.cfg"
  
There you go, the config file is up and should be working. You can customize the commands to whatever your preferences are, as this file is set up to my preferences :)
